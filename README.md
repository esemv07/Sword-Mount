## What is it?
I have designed a sword mount to hold the sword that I got from a medieval fair.

Here is the initial design:

### Features:
- The design has two options for the sword: hanging down from one of the mounts, or sitting horizontally across the two mounts.
- The design easily slots onto my shelves to stay secure.
- I have set it to pause before the top layers so that I can change the filament to make the letters and symbols a different colour to the base.


## The Print
In the print, the layer pause was set slightly too low so the colouring didn't work out exactly as I planned. I will just sand down the non letter and symbol parts so I can paint it.

Here is the viedo of the finished print:

## How it Works...
Here is a video of how it slots onto my shelf:

And here is what it looks like with the sword:
